# Text-Annotation
Dynamically providing hints on important topics of programming books for ease of understanding of users
Built on *Flask* framework and uses *javascript* as well for browser renderings


## Installation
Clone the repo and ```cd``` into the directory.
Python 3.0 and above version must be present in your system.
run the ```runner.py``` file
```bash
> python runner.py
```
You can view the web pages on your ```<localhost:port_number>``` accordingly.
## Modifications
 All the necessary stylings are present in static->css->folder and all the pages namely index to p5 are present in static->templates folder
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hrjs"></script>
```
[Hrjs](https://github.com/mburakerman/hrjs) is an external dependency used for highlighting those important keywords. 

## How it works
- the main running file is ```runner.py```
- each html page has a ```<script>``` which checks for the keyword present in our dictionary and accordingly highlights them and ceates hints for the scraped data dynamically on the right side of the page
- We dynamically scrape data and put it into ```out.json``` file in static->js folder only when there is a new keyword not present in our json file.
